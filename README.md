# fraud_detection

The bank’s customers are having their cards defrauded and their money is being spent by fraudsters. The bank is looking into introducing better transactional monitoring on activity on their customers’ cards. 

They plan to have a small team of fraud analysts who review risky-looking purchases and decide whether to allow or block the transaction. 

This team will have the capacity to review 400 transactions a month. The scores from the model will be used to decide which transactions the fraud analysts should review. The bank is requesting that after working these alerts, as much fraud value as possible has been prevented. 

The bank has provided 1 year of historical transactional data and fraud flags and asked you build a model which predicts the likelihood that a transaction is later marked as fraud.
